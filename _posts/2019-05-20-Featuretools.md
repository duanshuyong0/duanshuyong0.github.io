自动特征工程：



The traditional process of manual feature engineering requires building one feature at a time by hand informed by domain knowledge. This is tedious, time-consuming, error prone, and perhaps most importantly, specific to each dataset, which means the code will have to be *re-written for each problem.*

Automated feature engineering with Featuretools allows one to create thousands of features automatically from a set of related tables using a framework that can be easily applied to any problem.
